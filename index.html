                    and rural/urban settings. Popular styles of dress include draped garments such as sari and mekhela sador for women and dhoti or lungi or
                    panche (in Kannada) for men. Stitched clothes are also popular such as churidar or salwar-kameez for women, with dupatta (long scarf) thrown
                    over shoulder completing the outfit.</p>

            <p>The salwar is often loose fitting, while churidar is a tighter cut. The dastar, a headgear worn by 
                    Sikhs is common in Punjab.Indian women perfect their sense of charm and fashion with makeup and ornaments. Bindi, mehendi, earrings, bangles 
                    and other jewelry are common. On special occasions, such as marriage ceremonies and festivals, women may wear cheerful colours with various 
                    ornaments made with gold, silver or other regional stones and gems. Bindi is often an essential part of a Hindu woman's make up. Worn on their 
                    forehead, some consider the bindi as an auspicious mark.<br><br> Traditionally, the red bindi was worn only by married Hindu women, and coloured bindi 
                    was worn by single women, but now all colours and glitter have become a part of women's fashion. Some women wear sindoor &#8594 a traditional red or 
                    orange-red powder (vermilion) in the parting of their hair (locally called mang). Sindoor is the traditional mark of a married woman for Hindus. 
                    Single Hindu women do not wear sindoor; neither do over 1 million Indian women from religions other than Hindu and agnostics/atheists who may be married.
                     The make up and clothing styles differ regionally between the Hindu groups, and also by climate or religion, with Christians preferring Western and 
                     Muslim preferring the Arabic styles. For men, stitched versions include kurta-pyjama and European-style trousers and shirts.<br><br> In urban and semi-urban centres,

            <p>The two major dance forms in India are Classical and Folk dance. The major
                difference between classical and folk dance is the origin. Classical dance has a
                deep-rooted relationship with the Natya Shastra where the specific features of
                each of the classical dance forms have been mentioned. Folk dance on the other

            <p>Basic Elements of Classical Dance:
                The Natya Shastra written by Bharat Muni is the most prominent source for establishing the characteristics of the dances.
                <br>There are two basic aspects of classical dance
                &#8594 <b>Lasya</b> - It denotes grace, bhava, rasa and abhinaya. It is symbolic to the feminine feature of dance as an art form.
                <br>&#8594 <b>Tandava</b> - This is symbolic to the male aspects of dance and has more emphasis on rhythm and movement.
                <br>There are three basic elements of classical dance in the <i>Indian culture</i>
                <br>&#8594 <b>Nritta</b> - These are the basic dance steps and are performed rhythmically but
                devoid of any expression or mood.
                <br>&#8594 <b>Natya</b> - It means dramatic representations and refers to the story that is
                elaborated through the dance recital.
                <br>&#8594 <b>Nritya</b> - It refers to the sentiment and the emotions evoked through dance.<br><br> It
                includes the mime and the different methods of expression including mudras in
                the dance.
                    The Guru-Shishya paramapara forms the core of the Indian classical dance
                    forms. The basic meaning is that each dance form is related to a Guru (teacher)
                    and he/she transfers that knowledge of dance to a Shishya (Student).
                    <br>The 8 basic technicalities that are expressed in the classical dance &#8594
                    Shringer (Love), Hasya (Humorous), Karuna (Sorrow), Raudra (Anger), Veer
                    (Heroism), Bhayanak (Fear), Bibhats (Disgust), Adhbhut (Wonder).
                    Various classical dances in India are Bharatanatyam (Tamil Nadu), Kathak
                    (Uttar Pradesh), Kuchipudi (Andhra Pradesh), Odissi (Odisha), Kathakali
                    (Kerala), Sattriya (Assam), Manipuri (Manipur), Mohiniyattam (Kerala).</p>

            <br>
            <b> Age of Silent Films</b>- The earliest films were silent films. The dialogues
                delivered by act not audible to viewers because technology was not advanced
                enough to record both visuals and audio simultaneously. The plot used to be

            <p>&#8594 <b>Painting:</b><br>
                The tradition of paintings has been carried on in the Indian subcontinent since
                the ancient times. With time, Indian classical paintings evolved to become a sort

                    of blend of the various traditions influencing them. Indian paintings provide on
                    aesthetic continuum that extends from the early civilization to the present day.<br><br>
                    In the beginning Indian painting was essentially religious in purpose. But as
                    year passed, Indian painting became a fusion of various culture and traditions.
                    During the colonial era, Western influences started to make an impact on Indian
                    art. By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India
                    provided access to modem techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to
                    showcase these artists. Indian are got a boost with the economic liberalization of
                    the country since early 1990s. Artists from various fields started bringing in
                    varied style of work post liberalization. Indian art thus works not only within
                    the confines to academic traditions but also outside it.
