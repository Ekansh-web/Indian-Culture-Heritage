            <p>Indian architecture is rooted in its history, culture and religion. Among a number of architectural styles and traditions, the best-known include the many varieties of Hindu temple architecture, Indo-Islamic architecture, especially Mughal architecture, Rajput architecture and Indo-Saracenic architecture. Much early Indian architecture was in wood, which has not survived. Instead the earliest survivals are from the many sites with Indian rock-cut architecture, most Buddhist but some Hindu and Jain.<br><br>

                Hindu temple architecture is mainly divided into the Dravidian style of the south and the Nagara style of the north, with other regional styles. Housing styles also vary between regions, partly depending on the different climates. Haveli is a general term for a large townhouse.<br><br>

                The first major Islamic kingdom in India was the Delhi Sultanate, which led to the development of Indo-Islamic architecture, combining Indian and Islamic features. The rule of the Mughal Empire, when Mughal architecture evolved, is regarded as the zenith of Indo-Islamic architecture, with the Taj Mahal being the high point of their contribution. Indo-Islamic architecture influenced the Rajput and Sikh styles as well.<br><br></p>

various ages in different parts and regions of the country. Caves, Stupas, Pillars,
Temples and Indo-Islamic architecture are variety of architecture found in India

            architecture is one of the main forms of architecture seen in caves. It is the
            practice of creating a structure by carving it out of solid natural rock. The
            earliest caves were natural caves used by people for a variety of purposes such
            as shrines and shelters. Indian rock-cut architecture is mostly religious in
            nature. There are more than 1,500 rock-cut structures in India. Some of the

            Nyagodh Cave etc.<br><br>

            to Buddhism. Classification of Stupa: The stupas are classified into 5 main
             categories on the basis of the purpose or occasion associated with them. These
            are :<br>
            &#8594 <u>Relic Stupas:</u> These stupas were constructed on bodily remains of Buddha,
            his disciples and Bodhisattvas. These are the most sacred among all Buddhist
            stupas.<br>
            &#8594 <u>Object Stupas:</u> These stupas were built on personal belongings used by
            Buddha, his disciples and Bodhisattvas. Begging bowl, robes and Buddhist
            scriptures were kept in these stupas.<br>

            &#8594 <u>Commemorative Stupas:</u> These stupas were built in the memory of important
            events associated with the life of Buddha and Bodhisattvas.<br>
            &#8594 <u>Symbolic Stupas:</u> Stupas of this category were built to symbolize the invisible
            presence of Mahatma Buddha. These stupas reminded people that Buddha and
            his Dharma were there with them always and everywhere. Relics or objects
            were not used in these stupas.<br>
            &#8594 <u>Votive Stupas:</u> These stupas were built by devotees at important Buddhist
            centres and monasteries near the main stupas where they went there for
            pilgrimage. The construction of these stupas was carried out to earn merit, i.e.,
            to get the grace of God.</p>

            <p>&#8594 <b>Pillar architecture:</b><br>
            Erection of pillars is an age-old tradition in India. Development in the field of
            pillar architecture in a proper way commenced during the Mauryan age. The
            Mauryan pillars were rock-cut. These had proclamations inscribed on them and

            were used to spread the message of the Buddha by Emperor Ashoka.<br> The top
            portion of the pillar is called capital and it typically has animal figures like bull,
            lion, elephant, etc. These capital figures are carved standing on a square or
            circular abacus. The abacuses are on the base which could be a stylised inverted
            lotus. Example of pillars with capital figures: Sarnath, Basarah-Bakhira,
            Rampurva, Sankisa and Lauriya-Nandangarh.</p>
